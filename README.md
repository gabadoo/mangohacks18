## Inspiration
Food going to waste in people's refrigerators due to forgetting about items and their expiration dates is an issue faced by many. We believed it would be beneficial to have a notification system that informs you when your food is near or at its expiration date. Furthermore, to reduce waste, have the app provide recipes based on selected items.

## What it does
The user can input food items and their expiration dates. When the food item is 15 days or less away from its expiration date, a notification appears to inform the user. Then, the user can check off the items and search recipes via google search so they don't have to throw away their food.

## How we built it
We used Visual-Studio and the C# language to design and program our app. 

## Challenges we ran into
Our main challenge was incorporating the google search so users can find recipes based off the food items selected. The largest we faced was accessing google from our program and searching for recipes based on the items selected in the refrigerator inventory. Other issues faced were determining how to add and remove items from the inventory.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finishing a working app in less that 24 hours, and the implementation of google search for recipes!

## What we learned
We learned how to use the C# language and how to make an app using Visual-Studio.

## What's next for Spoiled
Implement AI/IoT to increase effectiveness of refrigerator inventory process to have a positive impact on food waste reduction and promote healthy living.

## Built With
Visual Studio, C#
